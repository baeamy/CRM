# CRM (Inventory and Customer Relationship Management System)
C++ program to manage inventory and customer purchases.

How to Run CRM:
To run this program, it is preferred that you use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA. Please clone this repository and run 'main.cpp'. Any additional tests you create must follow the '.txt' format of 'test1.txt', 'test2.txt', or 'test3.txt' and be placed in a folder named 'cmake-build-debug'.

Introduction:
This program was developed to manage inventory and customer purchases using command-based input from text files. It creates a database to store and modify customer records and inventory data by utilizing arrays of structs. Once all purchases are processed, it produces a detailed activity summary that includes inventory levels and top customers for each item type.

Instructions:
1. Ensure 'test1.txt', 'test2.txt', and 'test3.txt' are in the folder named 'cmake-build-debug'.
2. Run 'main.cpp'.
3. Observe the summary and the output in the terminal.
